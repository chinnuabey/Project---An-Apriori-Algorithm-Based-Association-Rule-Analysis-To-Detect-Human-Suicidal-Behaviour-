# Project---An-Apriori-Algorithm-Based-Association-Rule-Analysis-To-Detect-Human-Suicidal-Behaviour-
 Suicide is a major cause of death. It is also a complex public health issue and often
 preventable with timely intervention.Overall, the rate of suicide is increasing for
 various reasons.Understanding the patterns of suicidal behavior is pivotal for
 effective prevention strategies.
 Through this analysis, we aimed not only to identify prominent risk factors but
 also to comprehend the intricate relationships among various influencing variables.
 Our approach acknowledges the need for nuanced interventions tailored to
 individual circumstances, aiming to enhance predictive models and support
 systems in mental health care.
 In our study, we use an association rule analysis to find the most important rules to
 predict suicidal behavior from an available data set. One of the most powerful
 machine learning algorithms available for identifying associations within databases
 is the Apriori algorithm.
 Weused this algorithm to analyze association rules of suicidal behavior using a
 dataset of 150 instances and 6 impactful features. These include daily activities,
 family background, and answers to mental questionnaires and have been analyzed
 to find combinations that are associated with suicidal behavior. The study has
 resulted in some key rules for human suicidal behavior. The Apriori method has
 been used to identify the 11 most significant rules with the confidence of 0.65
